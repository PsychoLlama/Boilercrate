# boilercrate
This library is meant to provide similar functionality to what Twitter's Bootstrap framework gives (but trimmed down a touch), and add on some extra features bootstrap is lacking.

However, the main purpose of this library is to teach myself the Sass Preprocessor and more of the mechanics involved in responsive design.

This library is not meant to replace Bootstrap.
